### How to Run This Image
---
Simple example on how to run, so you can test. Just type in terminal:
```sh
$ docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 linhares/data-crow-server
```

After that, wait it load and then it will be acessible through your browser: http://localhost:8080/datacrow, user "sa", blank password.

The above command is just for testing purposes. It just starts a container on port 8080 of your machine.
Pay attention that when you close your terminal all saved data will be lost. 

For a persistent and more professional way, you may use the following command. Just type in terminal:
```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 -v /opt/mydatacrow:/opt/dc-user -e "XMX=2048m" linhares/data-crow-server
```
The above command will:
* start a background container
* persist database's data in a dir named: /opt/mydatacrow
* open port 8080 for web navigation, port 9000 and 9001 for Data Crow Client to connect
* use 2048Mb (2Gb) for java (Tomcat)
